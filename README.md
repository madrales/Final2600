This is a tutorial for learning the **Open Systems Interconnection Model**, otherwise known as the OSI Model. 

The [Open Systems Interconnection Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) is, "a conceptual model that characterized and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system" (Wikipedia). The OSI model is useful to learn for any position that relates to computing or digital systems. Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems, or even Computer Engineerring are all majors who can deal with the OSI model. The 7 layers of the OSI model are as follows:

1. [Physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer)
2. [Data Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer)
3. [Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer)
4. [Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer)
5. [Session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_layer)
6. [Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer)
7. [Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer)
