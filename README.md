# The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model)

This is a tutorial for learning the **Open Systems Interconnection Model**, otherwise known as the OSI Model. 

The [Open Systems Interconnection Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) is, "a conceptual model that characterized and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system" (Wikipedia). The OSI model is useful to learn for any position that relates to computing or digital systems. Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems, or even Computer Engineerring are all majors who can deal with the OSI model. The 7 layers of the OSI model are as follows:

1. [Physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer)
2. [Data Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer)
3. [Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer)
4. [Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer)
5. [Session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_layer)
6. [Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_layer)
7. [Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer)

## Physical Layer:

The [Physical Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer) is the first layer in the OSI model. The Physical layer deals with the electrical transmissions in a network. The [Protocol Data Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_data_unit) for the Physical Layer is the [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit). The bits are sent across a physical link that connects two [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) together to pass the electrical impulses
